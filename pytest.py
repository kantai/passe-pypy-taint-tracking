PyPy Test runner interface
--------------------------

Running pytest.py starts py.test, the testing tool
we use in PyPy.  It is distributed along with PyPy,
but you may get more information about it at
http://pytest.org/.

Note that it makes no sense to run all tests at once.
You need to pick a particular subdirectory and run

    cd pypy/.../test
    ../../../pytest.py [options]

For more information, use pytest.py -h.

Process for upgrading the stdlib to a new cpython version
==========================================================

.. note::

    overly detailed

1. check out the branch vendor/stdlib
2. upgrade the files there
3. update stdlib-versions.txt with the output of hg -id from the cpython repo
4. commit
5. update to default/py3k
6. create a integration branch for the new stdlib
   (just hg branch stdlib-$version)
7. merge vendor/stdlib
8. commit
10. fix issues
11. commit --close-branch
12. merge to default

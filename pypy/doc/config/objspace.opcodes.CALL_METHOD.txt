Enable a pair of bytecodes that speed up method calls.
See ``pypy.interpreter.callmethod`` for a description.

The goal is to avoid creating the bound method object in the common
case.  So far, this only works for calls with no keyword, no ``*arg``
and no ``**arg`` but it would be easy to extend.

For more information, see the section in `Standard Interpreter Optimizations`_.

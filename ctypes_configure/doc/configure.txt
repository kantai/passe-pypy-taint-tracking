ctypes configure
=================

idea
====

One of ctypes problems is that ctypes programs are usually not very
platform-independent. We created ctypes_configure, which invokes gcc
for various platform-dependent details like
exact sizes of types (for example size\_t), #defines, exact outline
of structures etc. It replaces in this regard code generator (h2py).

installation
============

``easy_install ctypes_configure``

usage
=====

`sample.py`_ explains in details how to use it.
